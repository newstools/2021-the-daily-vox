During the January 25 sitting of the State Capture Commission, Sydney Mufamadi, the chairperson of the high-level panel into the State Security Agency (SSA) told the commission that the Fees Must Fall movement was infiltrated by the SSA. Mufamadi said the SSA panel was told that Project Academia was designed to intervene in the #FeesMustFall protests and influence the direction of the student movement. The #FeesMustFall movement was a student movement started in 2016 that called for tuition-fee university, outsourcing and decolonisation about universities amongst other demands.
