We cannot underestimate how critical strong leadership is in all aspects of our lives. In ‘Leadership Lessons From Books I Have Read’, Professor Tshilidzi Marwala adopts the thesis that the source of good leadership is knowledge, and the source of knowledge is experience. If leadership is derived from knowledge and knowledge is derived from experience, the ‘experience’ in this book is from 50 books that Professor Marwala has read. Divided into four sections, Professor Marwala shares his leadership lessons in the areas of Africa and the diaspora; the search for the ideal polity; science, technology and society; and the leadership of nations.
